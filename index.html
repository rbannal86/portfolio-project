            <p class="section-content" id="about-me-content">As a kid, I spent most of my free time in front of a computer playing games. In high school, I became interested in what was going on behind the screen. I found the concepts of coding engaging and the work challenging, but I didn't think of it as a future career. I enrolled at Western Michigan University as a history major, switched before the first day of classes to microbiology, and eventually transferred to the University of Michigan where I graduated with a BA in English Literature and Language. After college, I pursued personal creative projects, like poetry and webcomics. To make ends meet, I got a job in food-service. To my surprise, I fell in love with the creativity, the need for fast-paced problem solving, and the feeling of being part of a team. After ten years and a journey that ended with me being a pastry chef, I realized that a kitchen wasn't the right work environment for me. 

                Creativity, problem-solving, and teamwork were always the highlights of my foodservice career, and I see web development as a fitting next step. And maybe, with a little luck, I'll finally find a job that doesn't involve the occasional ER visit.
                
                When I'm not working, you can find me rewatching the same shows on Netflix, trying out new recipes in the kitchen, or just hanging out with my wife, my dog, and my two cats.</p>
